Welcome to Void Ray
-------------------

This project is for the purpose of exploring different ai techniques using openGL to help visualize what is going on, with [Programming Game AI by Example](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1556220782/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i01) as a guide.

Now uses cmake in order to make building easier on all platforms.

Also, Void Ray is using SDL as a cross platform timer, window manager, and resource loader.

Next Steps:

* Encapsolate rendering code to a generic class and away from Entity based classes
* Fix the current steering behavior
* Add addtional steering behaviors
* Read the next chapter
