Welcome to Void Ray
-------------------

This project is for the purpose of exploring different ai techniques using openGL to help visualize what is going on, with [Programming Game AI by Example](http://www.jblearning.com/catalog/9781556220784/) as a guide.

Now uses cmake in order to make building easier on all platforms.

Also, Void Ray is using SDL as a cross platform timer, window manager, and resource loader.

Next Steps:

* ~~Encapsolate rendering code to a generic class and away from Entity based classes~~
* ~~Fix the current steering behavior~~
* ~~Use custom tranform matricies to make nested game objects easier to manipulate~~
* Add addtional steering behaviors
* Read the next chapter
